# Do Disturb

[My Notes](notes.md)

Smartphone users are well aquainted with the "Do Not Disturb" feature. Allow us to introduce its companion, Do Disturb! This application lets your friends know when you are available to call and catch up. After logging in, the user sees which friends are available to call, facetime, etc. Users can set their own calendar and availability to let their friends take the turn and reach out as well. This is the perfect and polite solution to bridge the gap between family and friends that are either separated by long distances, busy schedules, or both.

### Elevator pitch

The simple design allows users to set personal availability and see their friends that are free for a call that very minute. Let this tool turn your long commutes, lonely lunch breaks, and wasted time into moments of connection!

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four different views: login, home, calendar, and friends.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, responsive features, and a color theme for unity.
- **React** - Utilized for routing components, displaying other users' status, and state hooks.
- **Service** - Used for login and retrieving availablility status. Third party call to sync with Google Calendar.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, friends, and schedule in database. Register and login users. Can only add friends with an existing account.
- **WebSocket** - When a user edits their availability, their changes will reflect on their friends' devices.
